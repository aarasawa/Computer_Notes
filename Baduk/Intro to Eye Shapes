#GoGame #EyeShapes

All shapes with an interior of 1 or 2 spaces are dead. 

Shapes with 3-spaces live or die depending on who moves next. All of these kinds of shapes
have a "vital point" that can create 2 eyes.

Shapes with 4-spaces are always live. Shapes with a straight line or in a z-shape are always alive.
If it is an L shape it is always alive, unless it is in the corner of the board. T shapes live and die based on who makes the next move. A square is always dead.

Most 5-space shapes are alive because of how many ways you can create 2 eyes.
