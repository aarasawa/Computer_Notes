### 1-2-Space Shapes
All shapes with an interior of 1 or 2 spaces are dead. 

### 3-Space Shapes
Shapes with 3-spaces live or die depending on who moves next. All of these kinds of shapes have a "vital point" that can create 2 eyes.

### 4-Space Shapes
Shapes with 4-spaces are always live. Shapes with a straight line or in a z-shape are always alive. If it is an L shape it is always alive, unless it is in the corner of the board. T shapes live and die based on who makes the next move. A square is always dead.

### 5-Space Shapes
Most 5-space shapes are alive because of how many ways you can create 2 eyes. Thumb shaped spaces live and die based on who can capture the vital point. Just below the top space of the thumb shape.

### 6-Space Shapes
All are alive due to how many way you can create 2 eyes. There is a special shape that where free spaces look like:
	X 
  X X X
    X X
With the vital point being at the center. The opponent can kill your shape if they capture that point.

### 7-Space Shapes
All 7 space shapes are alive. As long as you make the necessary responses they cannot die.
