### Equipment

- **Board**: A 19×19 grid (smaller 9×9 or 13×13 boards can be used for beginners).
- **Stones**: Black and white stones.

### Objective

The goal is to control the largest area of the board by surrounding empty areas and capturing the opponent's stones.

### Basic Rules

1. **Placing Stones**: Players take turns placing one stone on any empty intersection (point) on the board.
    - Black goes first.
2. **Capturing Stones**: A stone or a group of stones is captured and removed from the board if all the adjacent points (horizontally and vertically) are occupied by the opponent's stones, leaving no liberties (empty adjacent points).
3. **Territory**: After both players pass their turns (when neither player wishes to make a move), the game ends. The players then count the number of empty intersections surrounded by their stones (territory) plus any captured stones.
4. **Ko Rule**: A player cannot make a move that returns the game to the previous turn's exact board position. This prevents infinite loops.

### Basic Concepts

- **Liberties**: The empty points directly adjacent to a stone. Each stone must have at least one liberty to remain on the board.
- **Groups**: Stones of the same color that are connected horizontally or vertically.
- **Eyes**: Empty points within a group of stones that cannot be filled by the opponent without capturing the group. A group with two or more eyes cannot be captured.

### Scoring

- **Territory Scoring**: Each player counts the number of empty points they control (surrounded by their stones) and adds the number of captured stones.
- **Area Scoring**: Each player counts their stones on the board plus the empty points they control.

### Basic Strategies

1. **Corners First**: Start by securing corners, then move to the sides, and finally to the center.
2. **Connecting Stones**: Keep your stones connected to maintain liberties and form strong shapes.
3. **Cutting Off**: Try to cut your opponent's stones to reduce their liberties and capture them.

### Common Terms

- **Atari**: A situation where a stone or group of stones has only one liberty left.
- **Sente**: A move that forces the opponent to respond, giving the player the initiative.
- **Gote**: A move where the player does not have the initiative after the move.

### Playing the Game

1. Place the board on a flat surface.
2. Decide who will play black and who will play white (black goes first).
3. Take turns placing stones on the intersections of the grid.
4. Keep playing until both players pass consecutively, indicating they don't want to make further moves.
5. Count the score to determine the winner.
