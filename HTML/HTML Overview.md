#HTML #Overview

HTML stands for *HyperText Markup Language*. A *markup* language defines structure and presentation of raw text. Text that is wrapped in HTML elements can then be interpreted by a computer. *HyperText* is text displayed on a computer that provides access to other texts through *hyperlinks*. 

HTML is composed of [[HTML Elements]] which structure a webpage and define its content. You can look at element structure here [[HTML Element Structure]].
