*The fourth Noble Truth is the **Truth of the Noble Path to the Cessation of the Cause of Suffering**. One is to follow the Noble Path in order to attain the state in which there is no desire and no suffering. The elements of this Noble Eightfold Path are: 
	- Right View
	- Right Thought
	- Right Speech
	- Right Behavior
	- Right Livelihood
	- Right Effort
	- Right Mindfulness; and 
	- Right Concentration*
	Basically, in order to stop suffering it is prescribed to follow the Noble Eightfold Path. This Path would allow a person to become unbound by their desire, and hence unbound by suffering. 

*The world is full of suffering. Those who wish to escape from suffering must sever the ties of the worldly passions which are the sole cause of suffering. A way of life which is free from all worldly passion and suffering can only be obtained through Enlightenment. Enlightenment can only be attained through the discipline of the Noble Eightfold Path.*
	In this part, I am unsure if they mean that Enlightenment is the state of being free from worldly passions. However, they do undoubtedly say that reaching Enlightenment would end the suffering.
