###### Difficulty: <code> Easy</code>

###### Description: 
Given an integer <code>nums</code>, return the *largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed form three of these lengths.* If it impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0. 

###### First Impression
I am not sure how they are determining whether three values can form a triangle. A couple things are juggling around my mind: a^2 + b^2 = c^2 or 0.5 x b x height. The formula for calculating the hypotenuse is not correct in this case, because they don't have to be right triangles. I don't think the area is correct, either because plugging in any positive numbers into the base or height would yield a non-zero result. 

###### Solution
Going off the pattern that is apparent in the examples that two of the sides being larger than the third side is at least needed for creating a triangle. If we let *a* and *b* be the first two sides in a triangle, then the third side *c* should be smaller than the sum of them for it to fit in the triangle. 

``` python
def largestPerimeter(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
	# sort the array of sides
	# if nums = [1, 2, 1, 10]
	# nums becomes [1, 1, 2, 10] after.
	nums.sort()

	# iterate through the array starting from the third-largest to the largest
	# stepping down by -1
	# 1. for i in range(1, -1): -> [1, 2, 10]
	# 1. 1 + 2 !> 10 false
	# 2. for i in range(0, -1): -> [1, 1, 2]
	# 2. 1 + 1 !> 2 false
	# return 0
	for i in range(len(nums) - 3, -1, -1):
		if nums[i] + nums[i + 1] > nums[i + 2]:
			return nums[i] + nums[i + 1] + nums[i + 2]
	return 0
