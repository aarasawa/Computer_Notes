###### Description
Given two binary strings *a* and *b*, return their sum as a binary string.

###### Hypothesis
An algorithm for taking corresponding indices from the two strings, *a* and *b*, adding them and appending the result to or a binary string. 

###### Iteration 1 & Solution
``` python
def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
	bina, binb = int(a, 2), int(b, 2)
	return bin(bina + binb)[2:]
```
This is a very pythonic approach. I convert the strings into numbers, add them, and return the binary string representation of the sum.
