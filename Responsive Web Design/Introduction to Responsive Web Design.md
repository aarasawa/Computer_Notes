**Responsive Web Design** or RWD allows web pages to look good on all devices, it uses primarily *HTML and CSS* not Javascript. Using CSS and HTML to resize hide, shrink, enlarge, or move content where convenient for design and the proper format. 

The goal is for webpages to look good regardless of device, rather than leave out information we are aiming to adapt content to any device. **Desktop, Tablet, Phone**.
