#BruteForce #PasswordCracking #BasicToolset #Cybersecurity 

A **brute force attack** is a method of attempting to guess passwords or keys by automating probing. Passwords are not usually stored in plaintext, rather as hashes. On Windows machines, files *unattend.xml, sysprep.inf, SAM*, Linux machines files: *shadow, shadow.bak, password*.  

A password cannot be calculated backwards from a hash value. A method like *offline brute-forcing*, determines passwords by matching stored hashes with randomly selected password hashes. 

Websites almost always have a login area for administrators, authors, and users. Usernames are often recognizable and complex passwords are rarely used because they are difficult to remember. 

Example of tools for login brute-forcing: Ncrack, wfuzz, medusa, patator, hydra.
