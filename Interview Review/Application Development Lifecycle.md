###### 1. Describe the Application Development Life Cycle (ADLC) and explain your experience with each phase. 
*What are the phases?*
	1. Planning and Requirement Analysis
	1. Design
	2. Implementation
	3. Testing 
	4. Deployment
	5. Maintenance
	6. Evaluation and Iteration
*My answer:*
	1. During *planning*, we outlined the scope of the project, functionality, time frame, and end-users. For each of these we did additional fleshing out what expectations were for the final product. It was here, where we further parceled out key parts of the project to see where responsibilities of each team stopped and started. For this project, there was the frontend and backend team. 
	2. During *design*, my team collaborated in crafting a design documents and diagrams. These included stuff like creating C4 models for modelling database interactions.
	3. During *implementation*, we worked incrementally. Starting with getting the core functionality up. Then expanding on them in subsequent weeks. During standups we would mention progress, roadblocks, reassessments, sometimes rework our proposals for functionality. Every week we would present sprint progress to our clients and gather feedback. 
	4. For *testing*, the latter half of implementation and our testing phase were meshed together to accommodate the time frame. On the backend, we conducted unit, integration, and load testing on our endpoints. To see that they are correctly handling requests along every part of the handling; and to see how they handle large scale user requests. The frontend team worked on usability and security testing. In addition, our clients helped us to do user testing with about 50 potential users in Stanislaus and Yolo counties.
