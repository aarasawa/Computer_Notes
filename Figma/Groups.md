**Groups** provide a way to combine multiple elements within the canvas. 

Unlike frames, groups can not show stylistic properties, they are just to organize elements and keep canvases tidy. 

*Groups are useful* for switching clusters of layers as visible or hidden according to design decisions. Using groups inside a frame help constrain in regards to the frame.
