**Frames** add layers directly to a container with a specific device or screen size. 

When to use frames:
	**Layout Grids**: 
		Grid help align and create visual structure and reduce the number of decisions to make. Ensure consistency and harmonious structure throughout designs, regardless of device types. 
	**Auto Layout**
		Feature used by frames. Structures adaptable design elements like buttons with adaptable lengths, lists with items that can add or remove stuff easily, etc.
	**Constraints**
		Allows for precise control over behavior of layers while frame is resizing. Horizontal direction constraints can be applied along the x-axis. Side constraint keeps layer's position relative to sides of the frame.
