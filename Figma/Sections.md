**Sections** are top-level elements on the canvas and offer some functionalities:
	- Designate specific areas for collaboration or ideation
	- Organize files and make navigating designs easier
	- Create links to a grouping of designs using sections
	- Sections can contain other sections but cannot be contained within frames or groups

For prototyping, sections are significant. Enable grouping and organization of prototypes and allow you to create connections that link flows across different parts of the prototype.
