#Styling #MapLibreGL 

A *style document* consists of root properties. 

Some root properties do not have influence over appearance or behavior of the map. 

Other root properties like **layers** and **sources** determine map features that appear on the map. 

Properties like **center**, **zoom**, **pitch**, **bearing** provide map renderer with default values when initially displaying the map.
