Delete amplify folder and run 
``` shell-session
npm create amplify@latest
```

It will install the dependencies and everything. Starting with *amplify init* will create a Generation 1 amplify folder, instead of 2. 

Run *npx ampx sandbox*, to start bootstrapping and get the backend running. 

Start local dev environment with *npm run start*.
